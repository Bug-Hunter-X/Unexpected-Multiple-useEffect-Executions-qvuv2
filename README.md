# Unexpected Multiple useEffect Executions in React

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React's `useEffect` hook.  The `useEffect` hook, even when given an empty dependency array (`[]`), might run multiple times unexpectedly.

## The Problem
The provided code uses `useEffect` with an empty dependency array, conventionally indicating that the effect should only run once after the initial render. However, depending on the component's lifecycle and other factors, it might run more frequently.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing how the component renders and updating the state. The problem is usually caused by external factors updating the component that are not captured in the dependencies.  In many cases, it might be an error in the component's logic, or it may require adding additional dependencies to the `useEffect` hook to properly control its execution.
